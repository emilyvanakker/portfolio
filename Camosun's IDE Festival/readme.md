# Developing Camosun's IDE Festival Web App

[IDE Festival](https://ide.camosun.bc.ca/)

## About

 In year two, my cohort designed and developed a platform to host Camosun's Interdisciplinary Education Festival. Due to the pandemic, the festival had moved online. While there was an existing WordPress site, faculty had thrown it together in a hurry for the previous year and sought improvement.

This was the first project we worked on where the entire class was involved, and it took some adjusting to establish teams for design, marketing, communications, and development. Once we had filled out the teams, we began documenting the critical path and the potential features that the faculty requested. 

The class decided that this was a great opportunity to get experience building a web application from scratch. The development team chose to move ahead using a MERN stack as we used React and MongoDB in the semester prior.

Unfortunately,  a computer science instructor was supposed to guide us through this project, but they were not available because of unforeseen circumstances. This complication put a lot more pressure on us as students to lock down a process and pull it together.

Additionally, because so many different faculties were involved, we didn't receive a clear direction to move forward in. As clients do, many really neat features and add ons got brought up during our meetings, and this was our first real experience managing a client's expectations.

Overall, this was a major learning curve for everyone involved in the project. Despite the obstacles, my cohort was able to pull together a functional platform that met all the critical needs of the festival. 

## My Role

From the beginning of the project, I knew I wanted to be on the front-end development team. I had previous experience from my co-op and knew I would be the most effective in helping the other front-end devs and managing the design expectations. 

Up until this point, I had not worked within the React framework, only in an HTML file. It was challenging to figure out how to configure the components, their styling, and passing data. However, over the three months of development, I got much more comfortable and took over much of the styling because I became so efficient.

Components I built:

-	Navigation bar
-	Header 
-	Footer
-	Landing page 
-	About Us page
-	Workshop page

Components helped with:

-	Projects page
-	Programs page
-	Sponsorâ€™s page
-	Events card

Other contributions:

-	Participated in individual team member calls to help troubleshoot
-	Reached out to the design team to sort out any issues with the design brief or consult on last-minute changes
-	Helped bug fix when data or content was not displaying correctly
-	Tested the form and content submissions

## Reflection

I see this project as one of my most significant challenges in development thus far. Learning how to work in a new environment, handle others' expectations, and troubleshoot remotely was a valuable experience. It taught me just how important it is to have a process for your work and a structure for how all teams communicate. The skills I gained from this project gave me the confidence to create my capstone project in the following semester.
