# Rental Connections - Capstone Project

*Disclaimer: This project is currently in progress so this is a sample until I have time to write a more comprehensive description. 
Can’t wait? I am happy to answer any questions you have in an interview - you can reach me at* **emily.vanakker@gmail.com.**

## The Idea

For my Entrepreneurial class, I had to create a business plan as the final project. After some brainstorming, I came up with the idea for a web application – an online marketplace dedicated to rental listings. Of course, there's Facebook and Used.ca, but I've witnessed first-hand the inadequacy of those tools.

## Sponsor Responsibilities

After compiling a basic overview of the project, I decided to submit it for the capstone term to build what I had already envisioned. The first to join my team was my close friend, as my right-hand and design lead. Before the capstone term started, there was a meet and greet event for sponsors to choose a development team. In the end, I selected a three-woman group whose skills complemented ours.

## Implementaion Approach

Our team went with an Agile workflow, dividing the project into two-week-long sprints, reserving the last sprint for testing. Monday through Friday, we met in the morning for a scrum meeting or sprint planning session. Attendance for all our meetings was excellent throughout the semester. As both a developer and a client, I participated in all the team meetings, dynamically switching between my roles.
