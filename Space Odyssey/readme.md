# Space Odyssey - Unity VR

### Intro

You step into a corridor, walls covered in panels, buttons, and colorful lights. Some flash, some remain persistently bright. A faint and constant humming surrounds you, with small irregular and offbeat beeps. This station feels almost alive. A large red light flashes on and off straight ahead. It sits above a big metal door exactly like the one that has automatically slid shut behind you. You know it’s the only way out. Glancing over at one of the many windows lining the corridor, you see it, the great expanse of space that spans between celestial bodies. It is dark yet cosmic and vibrant all at once. The thought crosses your mind; mere metal and glass are all that separates you from the vast silence of the great cosmos. The constant buzzing of the machines that create your oxygen reminds you of just how alone you are. *You have to get out.*

### About

Space Odyssey is a virtual reality game set in space. The beginning scene places you at the far end of the space station when you hear a woman’s voice telling you about airborne contamination in Bay 4. Lockdown protocol has commenced, and you now only have 20 minutes to complete the puzzles and evacuate the Arc.
